This exercise is about learning how to resolve a conflict between two different versions of a file, so that I can use these skills in digital history projects.. 
I also am trying to make a folder into a repository, and taking snapshots of all of my changes.
Another thing that I am doing is editing the file a number of times, so that I can see the way I can use git to track different changes in a file.
This file has now become a different branch, under the title 'experiment', so I can edit it seperately from the other file.
Finally, I merged this experiment file with the master file, resolving the conflict!
